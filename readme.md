# Temperature Analysis and Machine Learning Model  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on temperature data analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning model development. The workflow is divided into two Jupyter notebooks:  

- **Tranzmeo (6).ipynb** â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization  
- **ml-model.ipynb** â€“ Machine Learning Model Implementation
- - **map.png** â€“ Visualization of regions in maps 

Additionally, the **Documentation.docx** provides a detailed explanation of the methodology, implementation, and analysis.
